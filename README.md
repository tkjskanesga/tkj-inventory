### ⚙️ Deployment Guide

#### Prerequisites
- A **LEMP Stack** (Linux, Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP) is required.
- **PHP extensions**: `pdo_mysql`, `gd`, `curl`, `mbstring`.

#### 1. Server Configuration

**Nginx**
- Edit your Nginx configuration (e.g., `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) to allow larger file uploads for evidence photos and backups.
  ```nginx
  http {
      # ... other settings
      client_max_body_size 25M;
  }
  ```

**PHP**
- Set your timezone in both `php.ini` files:
  - `/etc/php/<version>/fpm/php.ini`
  - `/etc/php/<version>/cli/php.ini`
- Find the line `;date.timezone =` and set it to your location, e.g.:
  ```ini
  date.timezone = Asia/Jakarta
  ```

#### 2. Installation Steps

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleafarrel-id/tkj-inventory.git
```

**2. Move to Web Directory**
```bash
sudo mv tkj-inventory /var/www/html/
```

**3. Configure Nginx Web Root**
- Edit your Nginx server block configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`).
- **Point the `root` directive to the `/public` directory.**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com;
    root /var/www/html/tkj-inventory/public; # <-- Point here

    index index.php index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php<your-version>-fpm.sock;
    }

    # Deny access to sensitive directories
    location ~ /(api|config|temp) {
        deny all;
    }
}
```
- Restart Nginx to apply changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**4. Set Up the Database**
- Create the database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE tkj_inventory;
```
- Import the SQL schema and default admin user:
```bash
mysql -u your_username -p tkj_inventory < /var/www/html/tkj-inventory/tkj_inventory.sql
```
> **Default Admin Credentials:** `username: admin`, `password: admin123`

**5. Update Application Configuration**
- Edit the configuration file: `config/config.ini.php`.
- Fill in your database credentials:
```php
define('DB_NAME_CONFIG', 'tkj_inventory');
define('DB_USER_CONFIG', 'your_username');
define('DB_PASS_CONFIG', 'your_password');
```
- This step is **crucial** for the application to connect to the database.

**6. Set Permissions**
- The web server needs to be able to write to certain directories for image uploads and temporary files.
```bash
# Set ownership to the web server user (e.g., www-data)
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/tkj-inventory
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/tkj-inventory
```

**7. Configure Google Drive Backup (Optional)**
- **Create a Google Apps Script:**
  - Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com).
  - Create a new project.
  - Copy the entire content of `app_script_api.txt` from this repository and paste it into the script editor.
  - Set a strong `SECRET_KEY` inside the script.
  - Deploy the script as a **Web app**.
  - Authorize the script's access to your Google Drive.
  - Copy the generated Web app URL.
- **Update `config/config.ini.php`:**
  - Paste your Web app URL into `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL`.
  - Paste your secret key into `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_SECRET`.
  - Create folders in your Google Drive for backups and get their IDs. Paste them into the `GOOGLE_DRIVE_*_FOLDER_ID` constants.

You're all set! Open your browser and navigate to your domain. 🎉
